# Vole

What if Go had even smaller syntax? What if it was off-sided? What if it had
compile-time preprocessing? I hope to answer these questions with __Vole__.

## Motivation

Go is great, I love Go. But I wondered what if I made a language, that just used
Go for it's actual implementation because the Go standard library is brilliant.
Also, what if I got rid of all the implied syntax that is understandable from
context alone. Thus, Vole. Also, to make it a bit smaller I got rid of blocks and
went with off-side (tab spaced) like Python.
